Simple Kaggle Cats and Dogs CNN.

I also used TensorBoard to optimise the NN. 

I am currently using a i5 Microsoft Surface Pro. Training the models took hours and I believe my CPU is a melted mess now.

I used different numbers for convolutional layers, nodes, and dense layers. The end result is that the best validation accuracy is pink (Conv 4, nodes 128, dense 1) although grey was also pretty good (Conv 3, nodes 128, dense 1) as it was 2nd best for both accuracy and loss (0.8175, 0.4404).

I will therefore save those two models and try to test it in real world applications because I sometimes have difficulties distinguishing my golden retriever from my black cat.
