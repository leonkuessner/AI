A Keras NN which predicts handwritten digits with 97% accuracy. Not only that but it will also find the handwritten digit on the image you provided, and you can have as many digits as you like, the model will still find all the digits and predict them

I used the MNIST dataset to train my model and the image is just a random combination of numbers. 

It is important to note that for this to work optimally, you should use black ink on a blank sheet of white paper.

The result of my model is in the Figure_1.png file. As you can see, I achieved 100% accuracy on  this test
